We need to prepare the SD card by flashing the Raspbian OS. You can download the latest version of the OS from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

For flashing the OS you can use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

Now select the downloaded OS by clicking on the ```Select Image```

The best thing about the BalenaEtcher is that it will automatically detect the removable device and makes your work easier by doing the necessary settings.

Now the last process is to flash the file for that click on ```Flash``` and it takes some time to finish the flashing and validation.

After OS get flashed to the SD card (I have used 16 GB one). Insert it into the Raspberry Pi and connect your HDMI cable, keyboard, mouse and Ethernet. Now connect the power adapter and your Pi is ready to use.
